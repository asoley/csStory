James Gump, a local bankteller, received an invitation from an online friend to go to Brazil. Now Mr. Gump had never been to Brazil before, so he felt extremely nervous. As James tries to make his flight, he is able to go through customs and security, and is able to get onto his plane just fine. Though, once in the air, the plane hits some of the worst turbulence that James has ever felt. James is left fearing for his life, and passes out for the rest of his flight.

As James is passed out, he reminiscences about his life and whether it was well lived. He dreams about all the good times and the bad, the embarrasing and enjoyable, the despairing and joyful. While this is happening, his buddy Mike comes from the restroom and still perplexed as to why his buddy is still asleep for some timee. He reminds himself that James has a fear of planes and gets nauseauted during takeoff and passes out.

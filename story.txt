James Gump, a local bankteller, received an invitation from an online friend to go to Brazil. Now Mr. Gump had never been to Brazil before, so he felt extremely nervous. As James tries to make his flight, he is able to go through customs and security, and is able to get onto his plane just fine. Though, once in the air, the plane hits some of the worst turbulence that James has ever felt. James is left fearing for his life, and passes out for the rest of his flight.
